# Store / Product Management System - Python

## 📌 Project Description
This is a console-based Store / Product Management System written in Python.  
It allows users to manage products in a store, including adding, deleting, updating, displaying, and searching products.  
The program uses Object-Oriented Programming with `Product` and `Store` classes to organize the data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `time`  

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Product**: Add new products with ID, name, quantity, and price.  
- **Delete Product**: Remove a product from the store using its ID.  
- **Update Product**: Update product ID, name, quantity, or price.  
- **Show All Products**: Display all products with detailed information.  
- **Search Product**: Find a product by ID and display its details.  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures proper input for numeric fields (ID, Quantity, Price).  
- **Clear Screen and User-friendly UI**: Uses `os.system` for console readability.
